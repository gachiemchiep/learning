        semaphore, log など

read http://lass.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/courses/fall15/lectures/

OS Service Hardware Support
Protection Kernel/user mode, protected instructions, base/limit registers
Interrupts Interrupt vectors
System calls Trap instructions and trap vectors
I/O Interrupts and memory mapping
Scheduling, error recovery, accounting Timer
Syncronization Atomic instructions
Virtual memory Translation look-aside buffers

System Calls  : Win32 API, POSIX API, Java API

Process Control Block (PCB): OS data structure to keep track of all processes

Communication among threads is typically done through shared variables

semaphores  : have many draw backs

-> use a higher level primitive called  "monitors"

deadlock
