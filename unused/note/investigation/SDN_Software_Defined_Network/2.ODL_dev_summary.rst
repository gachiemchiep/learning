OpenDayLight Development in Summary
=======================================

ALl the work can be summaries in the following steps

1. Creat toy networks
    a. Use mininet, docker, etc to create nodes
        For docker :
            create image's instance without network
            then use pipework to assign
    b. Use Open vSwitch to bind these nodes together and form a toy networks
3. Add controller to the toys networks
    Controller can be 1st generation (POX, NOX, etc)
    Or 2nd generation : OpenDayLight
4. By using these Controller's plugins, features, we can program the flow, edit the network configurations, etc

Northbound and Southbound plugins

    Northbound plugins: The two most commonly used northbound plugins are RESTconf (enabled by installing odl-restconf) and NETCONF (enabled by installing odl-netconf-mdsal feature) interface to MD-SAL. Both of these can be used in combination with an intent layer.

    Southbound plugins: OpenFlow plugin (enabled by installing odl-openflowplugin-southbound feature) and NETCONF connector (enabled by installing odl-netconf-connector-all feature) are two commonly used southbound plugins.

Use Eclipse with OpenDayLight OOmph enable to edit the source code
