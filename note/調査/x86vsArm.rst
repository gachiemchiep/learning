What is x86 and arm
    ISA : instruction set architecture

what is ISA:
    show the way how software talk to hardware

ISA examples :
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instruction_set_architectures

How good is a ISA?
    It is depended on "hardware compability"
        x86 is not a good ISA design but because of Intel, It is still alive and
        developing

Technique different
    see, slide 3 for more details

    x86 :
        Intel product
        highest revenue
        CISC      Complex Instruction Set Computing
            -> high power consumption

    arm :
        Arm holding
        most units sold
        RISC      Reduced Instruction Set Computing
            -> low power consumption

Both x86 and arm can be manufactured by third-party company

power consumpotion per unit is not a big deal
    server, workstation, gaming, ...    -> use x86

power consumption per unit is a big deal
    smartphone, tablet, embedded device,...     -> use arm
